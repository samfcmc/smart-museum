# Smart Museum
Smart Museum app based on Smart-Places approach

## Requirements
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Grunt CLI](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

## Run in your local machine:
### Install dependencies
First, you need to install all the dependencies. Simply use npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running
Just run:
```
grunt
```

After you start the local web server you can access the web app in:
http://localhost:9000

This web app will only work well running inside of the [Smart Places Android app](https://github.com/samfcmc/master-thesis/tree/master/SmartPlacesAndroid).
This was just an academic project I develop to try to demonstrate that this concept works.
